# Ocho Loco (Crazy Eigths)

## About
This is a quick and dirty implementation of the Crazy Eights cards game using the Unity engine. I made this so that I could play with my family while on quarantine. The game is in Spanish, since my family speaks Spanish.

## Assets used
- DOTween by Demigiant
- Photon PUN by Exit Games
- Boardgame pack v2 by Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl)
